# Necro Jam
A (horrible) "game" from a "game jam" which is really just me using a game jam theme generator. It is a "game" made in 30 minutes (with a ~five minute time extension) on a public computer (which is why the uploaded footage has a username of PUBLIC.DESKTOPXRB^#&$TGYU#TE&*#iry7u).

The theme was "Death Is Not The End". ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/104037142/210912976-ac7c5a68-7803-4be8-89f6-6c4f365a2bf0.png)

The theme was applied by... nothing happening when you die... whoops
